Potential Results & Discussion  
Our potential results will be measured by the computed danger scores. We’re expecting teams with a higher amount of fouls, yellow cards, and red cards to lead to a more dangerous match.  Since our data set has a booking points statistic counting yellow cards as 10 points and red cards as 25 points, we will use these as weights, and we will give fouls an arbitrary weight of 3 since fouls are less severe than yellow cards but still lead to penalty kicks. We will normalize these three values to get a standardized score.  
Each team will be evaluated individually. Since we are also accounting for referee in each match, the more lenient the referee is, the better.
